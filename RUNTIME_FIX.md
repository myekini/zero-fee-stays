# Runtime Error Fix Summary

## Issue
```
Runtime Error
Cannot find module './vendor-chunks/tailwind-merge.js'
```

## Root Cause
The `tailwind-merge` package was not properly installed as a dependency, causing the build system to fail when trying to resolve the module.

## Solution
1. **Cleared build cache**: Removed `.next` directory
2. **Installed missing dependency**: `npm install tailwind-merge`
3. **Verified dependencies**: Confirmed all UI utility dependencies are present
4. **Tested build**: Ran successful production build

## Dependencies Verified
- âœ… `tailwind-merge@2.6.0` - For merging Tailwind classes
- âœ… `clsx@2.1.1` - For conditional class names
- âœ… `class-variance-authority@0.7.1` - For component variants

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **RESOLVED** - Application builds and runs successfully

## Files Affected
- `lib/utils.ts` - Uses `twMerge` from `tailwind-merge`
- All UI components using `cn()` utility function

## Next Steps
The application is now ready to run in development mode with:
```bash
npm run dev
```
