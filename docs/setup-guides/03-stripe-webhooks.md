# Stripe Webhook Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to set up Stripe webhooks for HiddyStays to ensure reliable payment processing.

---

## Why Webhooks Are Important

**Without webhooks:**
- Payment confirmation relies on user returning to success page
- If user closes browser, booking might stay "pending"
- Less reliable payment tracking

**With webhooks:**
- Stripe notifies your server directly when payment succeeds
- Works even if user closes browser
- Handles edge cases (refunds, failed payments, etc.)
- Production-grade reliability

---

## Local Development Setup

### Step 1: Install Stripe CLI

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
```

**Windows:**
Download from: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/latest

### Step 2: Login to Stripe CLI
```bash
stripe login
```

This will open your browser to authorize the CLI.

### Step 3: Forward Webhooks to Local Server
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/payments/webhook
```

You should see output like:
```
> Ready! Your webhook signing secret is whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Step 4: Update .env.local
Copy the webhook signing secret and add to `.env.local`:
```bash
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Step 5: Test Webhook
In another terminal, trigger a test event:
```bash
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

Check your Next.js server logs - you should see:
```
‚úÖ Webhook received: checkout.session.completed
```

---

## Production Setup

### Step 1: Deploy Your Application
First, deploy your Next.js app to production (Vercel, Railway, etc.)

Your webhook URL will be:
```
https://your-domain.com/api/payments/webhook
```

### Step 2: Create Webhook in Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Enter your webhook URL:
   ```
   https://your-domain.com/api/payments/webhook
   ```
4. Select events to listen to:
   - ‚úÖ `checkout.session.completed`
   - ‚úÖ `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - ‚úÖ `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - ‚úÖ `charge.refunded`

5. Click "Add endpoint"

### Step 3: Get Signing Secret

After creating the endpoint:
1. Click on the webhook you just created
2. Click "Reveal" next to "Signing secret"
3. Copy the secret (starts with `whsec_`)

### Step 4: Add to Production Environment

Add the signing secret to your production environment variables:

**Vercel:**
```bash
vercel env add STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
# Paste your whsec_... secret
```

**Railway:**
```bash
railway variables --set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

**Or through the dashboard:**
- Vercel: Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Railway: Variables tab
- Netlify: Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables

### Step 5: Test Production Webhook

1. Create a test booking in production
2. Complete payment with test card (4242 4242 4242 4242)
3. Check Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
4. Click on your webhook
5. Find the recent event
6. Check "Response" tab - should show "200 OK"

---

## Webhook Events Handled

### 1. checkout.session.completed
**When:** User completes payment on Stripe Checkout
**Action:**
- Updates booking status to "confirmed"
- Sends confirmation email to guest
- Sends notification email to host
- Creates in-app notification

### 2. payment_intent.succeeded
**When:** Payment successfully processes
**Action:**
- Backup confirmation (in case checkout.session.completed is missed)
- Updates booking to "confirmed"

### 3. payment_intent.payment_failed
**When:** Payment fails
**Action:**
- Updates booking to "cancelled"
- Notifies host of failed payment

### 4. charge.refunded
**When:** Payment is refunded
**Action:**
- Updates booking to "cancelled"
- Notifies host of refund

---

## Testing Webhooks

### Test with Stripe CLI (Local)

**Trigger successful payment:**
```bash
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

**Trigger failed payment:**
```bash
stripe trigger payment_intent.payment_failed
```

**Trigger refund:**
```bash
stripe trigger charge.refunded
```

### Test with Real Flow (Local)

1. Start local server: `npm run dev`
2. Start Stripe listener: `stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/payments/webhook`
3. Complete a real booking with test card
4. Watch webhook logs in terminal

### Verify Webhook Delivery (Production)

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Click on your webhook endpoint
3. View recent events
4. Check status codes (200 = success)
5. Click "Resend" to retry failed webhooks

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Webhook signature verification failed"

**Causes:**
- Wrong `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- Secret from test mode used in production (or vice versa)
- Request body modified before reaching webhook handler

**Fix:**
1. Verify you're using the correct secret
2. Check you have matching test/production keys
3. Ensure no middleware modifies request body

### Issue: Webhook receives event but booking not updated

**Debug steps:**
1. Check webhook logs: `console.log` statements in route.ts
2. Verify `booking_id` is in Stripe session metadata
3. Check Supabase database permissions
4. Verify `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set

### Issue: Emails not sending

**Debug steps:**
1. Check Resend API key is set in Supabase function
2. Verify `FROM_EMAIL` domain is verified
3. Check Supabase Edge Function logs
4. Test email function directly

### Issue: 500 error in webhook response

**Debug steps:**
1. Check Next.js server logs
2. Verify all environment variables set
3. Check Supabase connection
4. Test with `stripe trigger` command

---

## Webhook Security

### Best Practices:
1. ‚úÖ Always verify webhook signature (already implemented)
2. ‚úÖ Use HTTPS in production (automatic with Vercel/Railway)
3. ‚úÖ Never expose webhook secret in client code
4. ‚úÖ Handle events idempotently (prevent duplicate processing)
5. ‚úÖ Return 200 status quickly, process async

### What NOT to Do:
- ‚ùå Don't skip signature verification
- ‚ùå Don't hardcode webhook secret
- ‚ùå Don't process webhooks synchronously if slow
- ‚ùå Don't return errors for expected failures

---

## Monitoring Webhooks

### Stripe Dashboard
- Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
- View delivery attempts
- Check response codes
- Resend failed events

### Application Logs
Check your server logs for:
```
‚úÖ Webhook received: checkout.session.completed
üí≥ Processing checkout session: cs_test_...
‚úÖ Booking abc123 confirmed
‚úÖ Booking confirmation emails sent
```

### Set Up Alerts
**Recommended: Monitor failed webhooks**

1. Stripe can send alerts for failed webhooks
2. Set up in Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí [Your endpoint] ‚Üí Settings
3. Add email or Slack notifications

---

## Common Stripe Test Cards

| Card Number | Scenario |
|-------------|----------|
| 4242 4242 4242 4242 | Success |
| 4000 0000 0000 0002 | Decline |
| 4000 0027 6000 3184 | 3D Secure authentication |
| 4000 0000 0000 9995 | Insufficient funds |

**Expiry:** Any future date (e.g., 12/34)
**CVC:** Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)

## Webhook Development Checklist

### Local Development:
- [ ] Stripe CLI installed
- [ ] `stripe listen` running
- [ ] `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in .env.local
- [ ] Test events working
- [ ] Logs showing successful processing

### Production:
- [ ] Webhook endpoint created in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Events selected (checkout.session.completed, etc.)
- [ ] Signing secret added to environment
- [ ] Test booking completed successfully
- [ ] Webhook shows 200 response in dashboard
- [ ] Emails sending correctly
- [ ] Notifications created
- [ ] Error monitoring set up

---

## Alternative: Polling (Not Recommended)

If webhooks are difficult to set up, you can poll for payment status:

```typescript
// Not recommended - use webhooks instead
async function pollPaymentStatus(sessionId: string) {
  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.retrieve(sessionId);
  if (session.payment_status === 'paid') {
    // Update booking
  }
}
```

**Why not recommended:**
- Adds server load
- Slower confirmation
- Less reliable
- Misses edge cases
