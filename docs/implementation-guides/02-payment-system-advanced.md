> **Date:** October 13, 2025
> **Status:** ‚úÖ All Week 2 Tasks Completed

---

## üéØ What Was Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Webhook Idempotency & Error Recovery (COMPLETE)

**File:** [app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts](../app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts)

**Major Improvements:**

1. **Event Deduplication** ‚úÖ
   - Checks `stripe_webhook_events` table before processing
   - Returns success immediately if already processed
   - Prevents double-charging and duplicate notifications

2. **Error Recovery** ‚úÖ
   - Tracks processing attempts per event
   - Stores error details for debugging
   - Returns 500 on failure so Stripe retries
   - Marks events as processed only on success

3. **Transaction Logging** ‚úÖ
   - Logs every payment transaction to `payment_transactions`
   - Includes webhook event type in metadata
   - Tracks payment method and customer email

4. **Performance Monitoring** ‚úÖ
   - Measures processing time
   - Logs execution duration
   - Helps identify slow webhooks

**Code Example:**

```typescript
// Before (Week 1)
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(...);
  await handleCheckoutSessionCompleted(event.data.object);
  return NextResponse.json({ received: true });
}

// After (Week 2)
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(...);

  // 1. Check for duplicate (idempotency)
  const existing = await supabase
    .from("stripe_webhook_events")
    .select("processed")
    .eq("event_id", event.id)
    .single();

  if (existing?.processed) {
    return NextResponse.json({ already_processed: true });
  }

  // 2. Log event
  await supabase.from("stripe_webhook_events").upsert({
    event_id: event.id,
    event_type: event.type,
    processed: false,
    processing_attempts: (existing?.attempts || 0) + 1,
  });

  // 3. Process with error handling
  try {
    await handleCheckoutSessionCompleted(event.data.object);

    // 4. Mark as processed
    await supabase
      .from("stripe_webhook_events")
      .update({ processed: true, processed_at: NOW() })
      .eq("event_id", event.id);

    return NextResponse.json({ received: true });
  } catch (error) {
    // 5. Log error and return 500 (Stripe will retry)
    await supabase
      .from("stripe_webhook_events")
      .update({ last_error: error.message })
      .eq("event_id", event.id);

    return NextResponse.json({ error }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Payment Retry Flow (COMPLETE)

**File:** [app/api/payments/retry/route.ts](../app/api/payments/retry/route.ts)

**Features:**

1. **Smart Retry Logic** ‚úÖ
   - Validates booking can be retried
   - Checks property is still available
   - Verifies dates are still free
   - Recalculates amount (pricing may have changed)

2. **Comprehensive Validation** ‚úÖ
   - Cannot retry paid bookings
   - Cannot retry cancelled bookings
   - Cannot retry if property inactive
   - Cannot retry if dates now occupied

3. **Transparent Pricing** ‚úÖ
   - Shows old amount vs new amount
   - Notifies user if price changed
   - Uses same calculation as original booking

4. **Transaction Tracking** ‚úÖ
   - Logs retry attempt
   - Links to original session
   - Tracks amount changes

**API Endpoints:**

#### POST `/api/payments/retry`

```json
{
  "bookingId": "uuid"

---

## üöÄ How to Deploy Week 2

### Step 1: No new migrations needed!
Week 2 uses the same database schema from Week 1.

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for cron endpoint security
CRON_SECRET=generate-random-secret-here

# Already set from Week 1
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### Step 3: Test Webhook Idempotency

```bash
# Trigger same event twice
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
# Wait a few seconds
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed

# Check logs - second event should say "already processed"
```

### Step 4: Test Payment Retry

```bash
# 1. Create a booking that will fail
POST /api/bookings/create
# Use card: 4000 0000 0000 0341 (fails with insufficient_funds)

# 2. Try to pay ‚Üí will fail

# 3. Retry payment
POST /api/payments/retry
{
  "bookingId": "your-booking-id"
}

# 4. Use successful card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
```

### Step 5: Test Payment Status

```bash
GET /api/payments/{bookingId}/status

# Should show:
# - Transaction history
# - Failed attempts
# - Retry eligibility
```

### Step 6: Test Cleanup (Manual)

```bash
# Dry run first
POST /api/cron/cleanup-abandoned-bookings
{
  "dryRun": true,
  "maxAge": 60
}

# Check what would be deleted

# Actually clean up
POST /api/cron/cleanup-abandoned-bookings
{
  "dryRun": false,
  "maxAge": 60
}
```

### Step 7: Set Up Automated Cleanup

**Option A: Vercel Cron**
```json
// vercel.json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/cron/cleanup-abandoned-bookings",
    "schedule": "0 * * * *"
  }]
}
```

**Option B: External Cron**
```bash
# cron-job.org settings
URL: https://your-domain.com/api/cron/cleanup-abandoned-bookings
Schedule: 0 * * * * (every hour)
Headers: Authorization: Bearer your-cron-secret
```

## üìà Monitoring Queries

### Webhook Processing Stats

```sql
SELECT
  event_type,
  COUNT(*) as total_events,
  SUM(CASE WHEN processed THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as processed,
  SUM(CASE WHEN NOT processed THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as failed,
  AVG(processing_attempts) as avg_attempts,
  MAX(processing_attempts) as max_attempts
FROM stripe_webhook_events
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY event_type
ORDER BY total_events DESC;
```

### Payment Retry Success Rate

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT booking_id) as total_bookings_with_retry,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'succeeded' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful_retries,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'failed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as failed_retries,
  ROUND(
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'succeeded' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*),
    2
  ) as success_rate_percent
FROM payment_transactions
WHERE metadata->>'retry_attempt' = 'true'
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

### Abandoned Booking Cleanup Stats

```sql
SELECT
  DATE(created_at) as cleanup_date,
  SUM((metadata->>'deleted_count')::int) as total_deleted,
  COUNT(*) as cleanup_runs
FROM activity_logs
WHERE action = 'cleanup_abandoned_bookings'
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY cleanup_date DESC;
```

### Failed Webhook Events (Need Attention)

```sql
SELECT
  event_id,
  event_type,
  booking_id,
  processing_attempts,
  last_error,
  created_at
FROM stripe_webhook_events
WHERE NOT processed
AND processing_attempts > 3
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
